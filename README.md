A simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in JavaScript using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project allows two players to take turns, keeps track of scores, and persists game state across page reloads using localStorage.

## Demo

You can play the game live here: [Tic Tac Toe Demo]([https://your-demo-link-here.com](https://paskaeu25.github.io/tic-tac-toe/))

## Features

- Two-player gameplay (Player X vs. Player O).
- Scorekeeping for both players.
- Persistent game state using localStorage.
- Reset game and scores functionality.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## How to Play

1. Click on an empty cell to make your move.
2. The game alternates between Player X and Player O.
3. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbol wins.
4. If all cells are filled and no winner is determined, the game is declared a draw.
5. Use the "Restart Game" button to start a new game.
6. Use the "Reset Scores" button to clear player scores.
